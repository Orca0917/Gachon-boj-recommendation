# Gachon-boj-recommendation

lang: [ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· í•œêµ­ì–´](https://github.com/Orca0917/Gachon-boj-recommendation) | [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ENGLISH](https://github.com/Orca0917/Gachon-boj-recommendation/blob/main/README-us.md)

Hello, this repository contains the code for a web service prototype for recommending Baekjoon algorithm problems specifically for students at Gachon University. To actually implement this service, separate AWS account settings and dataset preparation are required. Please understand that the dataset is not included in the repository to avoid potential issues.

This web service can be accessed at [https://gachonboj.kro.kr](https://gachonboj.kro.kr) and is currently only available for Gachon University students. The service is scheduled to run only until early December, and we will notify you as soon as it is ready again.

The asset folder contains parameter files or matrix information of the trained models.
The crawler folder contains codes for crawling from the Baekjoon website.
The data folder is where the crawled data is stored.
The module folder contains the actual algorithms in operation.

## Web: Streamlit
The frontend is written in a prototype version using Streamlit, and you can choose the algorithm to be used from the sidebar. You can receive 5 problems tailored to user information by entering the ID you are using at [BaekjoonOnlineJudge](https://noj.am).

Streamlit is implemented as follows. If necessary, in the AWS environment, you may need to open the inbound for port 8501.

```absh
streamlit run app.py
```

## ML Algorithms

The algorithms applied in this project are machine learning algorithms that do not use deep learning and include 3 types:

- Matrix factorization
- User-based collaborative filtering
- Content-based collaborative filtering

Please refer below for descriptions of each algorithm.

<br>

### Matrix factorization
The Matrix Factorization algorithm divides one rating matrix into two latent matrices, and the inner product of the latent matrices becomes the rating matrix. It can predict ratings for values that have not yet been rated.

The Rating matrix consists of rows (users) and columns (problems), and if a problem is solved, it is filled with the value 1. In proportion to the solved problems for each user, negative sampling was performed to add a value of 0 to the data for values not yet solved. The formula is as follows:

$$
R = UV
$$

RMSE and log loss were used as model evaluation metrics, with RMSE value being 0.311 and Log Loss being 0.484.

$$ \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(\hat{y}_i - y_i)}{n}} \qquad \text{log loss}= y\log p+(1-y)\log (1-p)$$

<br>

### User based collaborative filtering

User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF) uses a rating matrix, here the user-item interaction matrix, similar to matrix factorization to calculate similarity. Similarity can be applied to Pearson similarity, Jaccard similarity, and Cosine similarity, and currently, **Cosine similarity** is being applied for the service. Using the User-item matrix, it recommends problems that have not yet been solved by finding the top $N$ users with the most similar problem-solving history.

<br>

### Content based collaborative filtering

In Content-Based Collaborative Filtering (CBCF), information other than the user's problem-solving history is used. In this project, user algorithm problem-solving skills were used, collecting information on 8 types of algorithm skills of users from [solved.ac](https://solved.ac). The algorithm information used is as follows:

Mathematics, Implementation, Greedy, String, Data Structures, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Geometry
Similar to UBCF, it recommends problems by finding other users most similar to these algorithm-solving skills. It has the advantage of being able to solve problems suited to skills as it is measured in points separate from problem-solving history.
